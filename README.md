# Intergrated-Water-Replenishment-and-Management-System

The basic idea of this project is to reduce the delay between the rise in water shortage situation and required action being carried out by the concerned authorities.
We have considered water sources for Boston, Chicago, New York City, Washigton DC and San Fransisco cities and monitored them using sensors. These sensors would send data to our management system about any shortfall in the water storage capacity.
Once the data is captured, the respective state authorities would collect weather forecast information and send the combined data to the analyst team.
This analyst team would consider various factors like water level, forcaseted rain amount, soil type, artificial water replenishment cost and interstate water transport cost and inform the state department about their analysis.
The state team would hereby inform the central authority about the required funds and their use.
The central team would ask the respective bank to release limited amount to a specific state authority.
On receiving the funds, the state authority can take effictive steps to address water shortage.

We have implemented this entire process in our project.
